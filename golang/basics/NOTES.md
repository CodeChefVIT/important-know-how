### To learn more about a function

<br />

```bash
godoc fmt Println
```


<br />
<br />

Note: Anything outside a function will need to be defined like this:

<br />

```golang
var a,b float64 = 2.2,3,3
```

<br />

But in functions we can use shorthand:

<br />

```golang
num1 := 2
```

<br />

NOTE: define any variable you don't intend to use as _ eg: _ := 2
